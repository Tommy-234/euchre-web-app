# euchre-web-app

Found at https://freethy-euchre.tk

This euchre web app has a Tcl backend with a React front end. I developed the back end and my brother did the front end. We completed this
project a couple years prior to uploading to Github. Since then it appears we have lost the source of the front end. We are just left with
the build.

The tcl web socket server is tested in Tcl 8.4 and 8.6. The script uses the websocket, json, and tls packages, found in the standard
tcllib (installed seperately).

Tcl can be downloaded from ActiveState here: https://www.activestate.com/products/tcl/downloads/

Tcllib can be dowloaded from: https://core.tcl-lang.org/tcllib/technote/56416fe9cf1b0c0f5cd535861225a56af8228999
I am using tcllib 1.17
