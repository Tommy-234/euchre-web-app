# euchre-web-app

Found at https://freethy-euchre.tk

This euchre web app has a Tcl backend with a React front end. I developed the back end and my brother did the front end. We completed this
project a couple years prior to uploading to Github. Since then it appears we have lost the source of the front end. We are just left with
the build.
